### Hi

Iâ€™m currently working as a Lead Software engineer at @RadicalImaging 

Here I share some of my ideas and projects.

I am currently learning rust as a system programming language and creating a database with it https://github.com/mateusfreira/nun-db to make the web in real-time easier for open-source lovers.
